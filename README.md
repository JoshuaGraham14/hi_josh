Hi fellow Josh Graham!

I can't believe I am using a Github to message someone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜…. And this may be the most out of the blue message you get all year ahaâ€¦

Basically, I am a student at university in the UK, and also a software developer like yourself, and I am interested in using your joshgraham.com for my small freelancing business. Itâ€™s just the PERFECT name (lol)!

I noticed the website hasn't been used in a long time so I was wondering if you would be interested in selling it?

Thanks a bunch!
Josh Graham

PS. I tried emailing you so I had to resort to this ðŸ˜‚
